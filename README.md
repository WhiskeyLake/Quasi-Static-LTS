**Quasi-Static Lap Time Simulator (LTS)**

A physics-based quasi-static lap time simulator for estimating race car performance on real-world circuits using grip, power, braking, and aerodynamic constraints.

This tool predicts:

Speed profile around a track

Time spent in each segment

Total lap time

Designed for fast performance evaluation, setup comparison, and motorsport engineering studies.

**Project Overview**

This simulator models a vehicle driving around a discretized race track.
At each track segment, vehicle speed is limited by:

Cornering Grip – Tire friction vs curvature

Acceleration Capability – Engine power vs traction

Braking Capability – Tire friction under deceleration

A forward/backward constraint propagation approach ensures the speed profile is globally feasible.

Lap time is computed by integrating:

**Methodology**

**1️⃣ Track Processing**

Track centerlines are imported (e.g., from GeoJSON) and converted into:

Arc length s

Curvature κ(s)

The track is resampled to uniform spacing for numerical stability.

**2️⃣ Cornering Speed Limit**

For each segment, the maximum speed allowed by lateral grip is computed:

​
where vertical load includes aerodynamic downforce.

**3️⃣ Forward Pass (Acceleration-Limited)**

Speed is propagated forward using:

Acceleration is limited by:

Engine power

Tire friction (traction circle / ellipse)

Aerodynamic drag

**4️⃣ Backward Pass (Braking-Limited)**

A reverse pass ensures the car can decelerate in time for upcoming corners by applying braking force limits.

**5️⃣ Final Speed Profile**

The physically feasible speed at each segment is:

**How to Run**
MATLAB
cd matlab
main


This will:

**Example Result**

Tested on the Baku F1 Circuit:

**Metric	Value
Track Length	~7.9 km
Predicted Lap Time	~1:49
Real F1 Benchmark	~1:41–1:44**

Given the quasi-static model (no transient tire/ERS effects), this is within realistic bounds.
